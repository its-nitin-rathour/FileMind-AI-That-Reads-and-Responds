## 🧑‍💻 Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/IntelliChat.git
cd IntelliChat
````

### 2. Create Virtual Environment (optional but recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
# Activate
# Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> If `PyPDF2` or `streamlit` are missing, you can install them individually:

```bash
pip install PyPDF2 streamlit langchain openai python-dotenv pandas
```

---

## 🔑 Setup API Keys

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```bash
touch .env
```

Add your OpenAI API key:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
```

> You can get your OpenAI API key from [https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)

---

## 📁 File Upload Format

* PDF: Any readable text-based document
* CSV: Well-formatted table with headers

Once uploaded, IntelliChat can answer questions **based on the content** of the file.

```

Then open your browser and go to:
